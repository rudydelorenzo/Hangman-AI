# Java Hangman AI
A Java-based AI that plays hangman!

## How does it work?
The user first types in a word. Then the computer will make the best guess it mathematically can for what each letter may be.

If it guesses too many letters wrong it'll lose, like in real hangman.

The program first reads all the lines from a file. Each line will be treated as a word that the user may have entered.
